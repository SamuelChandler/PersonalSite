# The Raymond Corporation
During my Spring 2023 semester I was extended the opportunity to work within the Product Engineering Team as a coop for a seven month period during the summer and fall sessions of 2023 at Greene NY. 

Upon considering the offer, I accepted with excitement to learn what it means to be a professional engineer and to work in a competitive environment. And The Raymond Corporation, one of the largest producer of electric lift trucks and supply chain solutions, did not disappoint. 

# Product Engineering

Within The Raymond Corporation, I worked in the Product Engineering team which worked to source alternative components for released trucks in the case of obsolescence or shortages in our supply chain. In addition, we would also work to make improvements to the released models for cost savings or for new safety standards or production methods that we are implementing in manufacturing. 

My job as a Co-op was to assist in these activities and to help the other employees within the department for these activities. This would usually involve performing testing, sourcing alternatives for older components, updating documentation, and also documenting new processes. 

# Projects

During my time at Raymond I got to work on multiple really interesting projects including the regular work I was doing to assist other team members with testing and finding alternative options for obsolescent parts. 

These range from developing trainings for PLC's, Developing a Python application for interpreting CAN messages, and Finishing up a Test fixture For testing cables that we want to validate.
