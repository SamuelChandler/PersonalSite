Good Morning or Afternoon, 

Thank you for taking an interest in what I've been working on and what I will continue to do in the future as I plan on posting a detailed explanation on each of my projects here as well as ones I will work in the future. 

Currently I am a senior at The University of Texas at Dallas working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I've worked in a variety of fields such as Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and as a SOC Analyst during my early undergraduate days.

Additionally for recreation, I absolutely love to work and learn more about video game design and also enjoy fencing, hiking, and weight lifting to keep in shape. 

I hope you find my exploits interesting and feel free to reach out to me if you find anything I do particularly interesting.

## Employment History 

### USAA
At USAA I worked as a software engineer within the Bill Pay department gaining experience in serverless tools using AWS through Lamda's and Step Functions to call AI tools through Bedrock and worked in quality assurance using tools such as Postman to validate the operation of endpoints in development.

### The Raymond Corporation  

In my time at The Raymond Corporation, I worked as a product engineering intern where I performed tasks relating to keeping their forklifts up to date after release and to maintain support for those products through sourcing alternatives for parts and creating tools to validate new parts that would be placed in production. 

For more on the activities and products that I worked on check out [*THIS POST*](../posts/Raymond)

### The University of Texas at Dallas ISO

During my earlier years as a sophomore/junior I had the opportunity to work in my school's Security Operations Center as an analyst were I learned about how to detect and secure their network and about computer and network security concepts first hand. 

Overall I left this experience learning tools such as Wireshark and Splunk and also gained a certain persistence that you can only get by working in a analyst position. 


## Projects 

### Beastia

Bestia or Project Kingdom is the video game project that I am currently working on that combines my passion of strategic games such as Fire Emblem with card games such as Magic the Gathering through a narrative experience.

*Looking forward to releasing a demo by the end of September*

### Personal Website

This is the website you are currently looking at! With the growth of my career and projects that I have been working, I found a need to keep track of it through a website for the sake of showing others what I have been working on in more detail. Going beyond what I could mention in a linkedIn post.  

### Project 21cm 

Project 21cm is my senior design project that I am currently the leader and programmer of. The core idea of the project is to create a radio telescope that will collect the magnitude of the hydrogen line and create an image of those magnitudes. 

For more information I created a post detailing the results of the project after the first semester [*HERE*](../posts/Project21)
