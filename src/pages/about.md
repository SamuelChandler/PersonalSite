Good Morning or Afternoon, 

Thank you for taking an interest in what I've been working on and what I will continue to do in the future as I plan on posting a detailed explanation on each of my projects here as well as ones I will work in the future. 

Currently I am a senior at The University of Texas at Dallas working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I've worked in a variety of fields such as Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and as a SOC Analyst during my early undergraduate days.

Additionally for recreation, I absolutely love to work and learn more about video game design and also enjoy fencing, hiking, and weight lifting to keep in shape. 

I hope you find my exploits interesting and feel free to reach out to me if you find anything I do particularly interesting. 

:)

For more on the activities and products that I worked on check out [*THIS POST*](../posts/Raymond)

### The University of Texas at Dallas 

During my earlier years as a sophomore/junior I had the opportunity to work in my school's Security Operations Center as an analyst were I got to learn about how to detect and secure their network and learn about computer and network security first hand. 

Overall I left this experience learning tools such as Wireshark and Splunk as well as gaining a certain persistence that you can only gain by working in a analyst job for long enough. 


## Projects 

### Beastia

Bestia or Project Kingdom is the video game project that I am currently working on that combines my passion of strategic games such as Fire Emblem with card games such as Magic the Gathering through a narrative experience.

*Looking forward to releasing a demo by the end of September*

### Personal Website

This is the website you are currently looking at. With the growth of my career and projects that I have been working on I found the need to keep track of it through a website for the sake of showing others what I have been working on that goes further than a resume. 

### Project 21cm 

Project 21cm is my senior design project that I am currently the leader for and also the dedicated programmer for the team. The core idea of the project is to create a radio telescope that will collect the magnitude of the hydrogen line and create an image of those magnitudes. 

For more information I created a post detailing the results of the project after the first semester [*HERE*](../posts/Project21)
